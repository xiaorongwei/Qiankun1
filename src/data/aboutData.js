            "The head of Nongse Nongxue Aikelangcai Farm has some knowledge. He once worked at Shibei Public Cave, but originally from the Wenjiang Agricultural Group, his family has been farming for generations. The high-quality Yongding is influenced by the Da Wu Mountain, which is prioritized by the authorities, and he has long pursued a farming life as reported in academic journals. In the water source protection group under Da Wu Mountain in Pingtung, he is committed to investing in organic agriculture, avoiding pesticides. However, under the heavy workload of frequent reports, the effort is significant, allowing him to gain some genuine knowledge. Although the cost of not using chemical fertilizers is higher and the yield is lower, it helps reduce costs for farmers and customers, promoting health! On this land of sustainable and healthy vitality, the annual organic tea production has been steadily increasing, with a sweet taste reaching a Brix level of 22 degrees. It has also passed organic safety inspections, while promoting Taiwan's high-quality tea leaves, advancing business in tasting/drinking/tea/Middle East markets."
