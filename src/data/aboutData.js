            '從年薪百萬的白領族變成在太陽下揮動鋤頭的農夫，王乾坤下的功夫比誰都多，他先到屏東科技大學農園生產學系旁聽，後來乾脆報考研究所就讀，還固定到農業試驗所鳳山分所荔枝實驗區當義工，就是為了學習農業知識與實務經驗，要種出品質頂級的荔枝。以台灣的氣候條件來說，不用農藥培植荔枝很困難，不施荷爾蒙荔枝的落果便會非常嚴重，常常一季的心血便這樣泡湯，但王乾坤笑著說：「本身讀化工就知道化學藥劑對身體有多不好了，有機栽培是我從一剛開始就決定要走的路。」',
            '王乾坤是台灣早期從事有機農業的先鋒，也是開始種有機玉荷包的第一人，他的認真和用心，終於呵護出品質頂級的荔枝，現在不時有農業團體前往觀摩請教，王乾坤也在社區大學開課傳授有機栽培心得。從外行人變種有機荔枝的達人，王乾坤靠得不是運氣，而是努力。'

            "The head of Nongse Nongxue Aikelangcai Farm has some knowledge. He once worked at Shibei Public Cave, but originally from the Wenjiang Agricultural Group, his family has been farming for generations. The high-quality Yongding is influenced by the Da Wu Mountain, which is prioritized by the authorities, and he has long pursued a farming life as reported in academic journals. In the water source protection group under Da Wu Mountain in Pingtung, he is committed to investing in organic agriculture, avoiding pesticides. However, under the heavy workload of frequent reports, the effort is significant, allowing him to gain some genuine knowledge. Although the cost of not using chemical fertilizers is higher and the yield is lower, it helps reduce costs for farmers and customers, promoting health! On this land of sustainable and healthy vitality, the annual organic tea production has been steadily increasing, with a sweet taste reaching a Brix level of 22 degrees. It has also passed organic safety inspections, while promoting Taiwan's high-quality tea leaves, advancing business in tasting/drinking/tea/Middle East markets."
